        <p>Hitchens posited that organized religion is "violent, irrational, intolerant, allied to racism, tribalism, and bigotry,
        invested in ignorance and hostile to free inquiry, contemptuous of women and coercive toward children" and sectarian,
        and that accordingly it "ought to have a great deal on its conscience". He supports his position with a mixture of
        personal stories, documented historical anecdotes and critical analysis of religious texts. His commentary focuses
        mainly on the Abrahamic religions, although it also touches on other religions, such as Hinduism and Buddhism. The book
        received mixed reviews, but sold well..</p>

        <p>The End of Faith opens with a literary account of a day in the life of a suicide bomber â€“ his last day. In an
        introductory chapter, Harris calls for an end to respect and tolerance for the competing belief systems of religion,
        which he describes as being <em>"all equally uncontaminated by evidence"</em>.While focusing on the dangers posed by religious
        extremist groups now armed with weapons of mass destruction, Harris is equally critical of religious moderation, which
        he describes as "the context in which religious violence can never be adequately opposed."</p>

        <p>n The God Delusion, Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that belief in a
        personal god qualifies as a delusion, which he defines as a persistent false belief held in the face of strong
        contradictory evidence. He is sympathetic to Robert Pirsig's statement in Lila (1991) that "when one person suffers from
        a delusion it is called insanity. When many people suffer from a delusion it is called religion."[3] With many examples,
        he explains that one does not need religion to be moral and that the roots of religion and of morality can be explained
        in non-religious terms.r</p>
