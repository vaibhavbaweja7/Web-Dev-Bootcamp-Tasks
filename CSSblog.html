            <h1>Animal Liberation</h1>
            <p class="firstparaborder">
                Animal Liberation: A New Ethics for Our Treatment of Animals is a 1975 book by Australian philosopher Peter Singer. It
                is widely considered within the animal liberation movement to be the founding philosophical statement of its ideas.
                Singer himself rejected the use of the theoretical framework of rights when it comes to human and nonhuman animals.

                Following Jeremy Bentham, Singer argued that the interests of animals should be considered because of their ability to
                experience suffering and that the idea of rights was not necessary in order to consider them. He popularized the term
                "speciesism" in the book, which had been coined by Richard D. Ryder to describe the exploitative treatment of animals

                    Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow (Hebrew: ההיסטוריה של המחר, English: The History of the Tomorrow) is a book
                    written by Israeli author Yuval Noah Harari, professor at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. The book was first
                    published in Hebrew in 2015 by Dvir publishing; the English-language version was published in September 2016 in the
                    United Kingdom and in February 2017 in the United States.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As with its predecessor, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, Harari recounts the course of history while describing
                    events and the individual human experience, along with ethical issues in relation to his historical survey. However,
                    Homo Deus deals more with the abilities acquired by humans (Homo sapiens) throughout their existence, and their
                    evolution as the dominant species in the world. The book describes mankind's current abilities and achievements and
                    attempts to paint an image of the future. Many philosophical issues are discussed, such as humanism, individualism,
                    transhumanism, and mortality.
